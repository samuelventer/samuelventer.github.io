# Why am I doing this?

> "I still see his face sometimes as he is fighting a blockage that should never have been there. If the hospital had been able to operate as it should have."

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was assisting in the ER when a Very Gentile and kind man was admitted. I happy husband and a father of two. He told me of his wife and children in school and how the pandemic affected them. That night, despite our best efforts, he was intubated and never spoke again. He passed away two weeks later in my care. Three days prior, his wife had passed away, and a week later, one of his daughters died—leaving only the youngest child.  

The hospital’s systems were compromised by ransomware, limiting our ability to provide timely care dispute the hard work I recall mangement, IT and clinical engeneering doing. Witnessing these consequences firsthand ignited a deep resolve in me to make a difference in IT and eventually  cybersecurity. I cannot stand by while technology failures cost lives.

## My Journey in Nursing

Since you are here, you know my name is Samuel, and for the past eight years, I worked as an Enrolled Nurse in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Nursing has been both challenging and rewarding: caring for ventilated patients, managing those on CVVHDF and inotropic support, and yes, I worked in the ICU on the frontlines during the COVID pandemic. I am also part of my hospital's Rapid Response Team and work as a medic at sports and other events. In 2025, I was recognized as one of the top 100 nurses in our hospital group, receiving a certificate of excellence for my work.  

But before nursing, I had a strong foundation and passion for IT. Life’s circumstances led me into healthcare, but my interest in technology never left me; it just took a back seat.

## Why I’m Returning to IT

Two main factors drive my return:

1. **A limitation in continuing formal nursing studies.**  
   Dispite my best efforts I study for a RN (Professional Nurse)
   This has motivated me to explore new avenues for growth and contribution.

3. **A lifelong passion for IT and cybersecurity.**  
   Personal experiences—including witnessing hacking incidents that affected friends, family,-my work- and even government systems—have fueled my determination to protect others and prevent digital harm.

## Why I’m Building This Site

Since I am not returning to college for IT, this site serves as a portfolio to showcase my practical work, personal labs, and projects. It is a record of my journey from nursing to IT, and a place where I can share evidence of my skills, receive feedback, and show potential employers what I am capable of.  

Thank you for visiting and being part of my journey as I work toward making a real, positive impact in the world of IT.
