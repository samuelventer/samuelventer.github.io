## July 2025
I just bought my new laptop, fresh with a Windows 10 install, which, on startup, informed me that Windows will be discontinuing updates.

So I installed a Linux Distro for the first time in my life. Scary thing, venturing into unknown waters; however, I did not find it at all as bad as expected. With YouTube and a couple of hours, Cinnamon is not that different from what I knew.

But all the tutorials just wanted to teach me about the terminal. Now I don't mean to brag, or anything, but I have been known to run an ipconfig or a netstat every once in a while in the Windows command line. But I never felt the need to really use more than that. Unless I was having a LAN party or looking for the default gateway, I had nothing to really do there.

So a friend recommended the book “Linux basics for hackers” to see what can really be done, and another, for the lols, sent me a video by Cyber Flows on Linux. So I gave Terminal a shot. ran my packet manager and installed Anki and gimp. Purely because they were the only programs I recognized.

So I went to LinuxJourney.com and over the wire. Then it struck me - this is gonna be hard. What even is a SSH? Why would I use it? Am I hacking? I don't want to be hacking. Then I met the man. Yes, than MAN. Manuals read like a foreign language close to your own. It seems familiar, and you should be able to understand it. But it doesn't make sense. That is when I remembered Cyber Flows informed me about TL;DR. It really is your friend.

I changed from a boot drive to a full install, then changed the Desktop environment to GNOME only because it is the only one I have found that has a decent Magifier comparable to Windows’s Magnifier. 

### Thoughts on this month

Learning Linux does not have to be that hard if you just want to use another operating system. Installing programs from sources other than your package manager is a bit of pain. But if you don't want ot be a superuser, you don't have to. And honestly, you don't need to watch a 6-hour tutorial that teaches you about the boot loader if you just want to use Libre Office and Anki - You will need to learn to talk to Terminal though.
