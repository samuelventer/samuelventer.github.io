## My Courses

### [Linux for Hackers by Network Chuck](/courses/linux-for-hackers/)
A fun and hands-on course that teaches Linux by Network Chuck on YouTube. Using a Virtual Machine from Hack the Box running Parrot OS. Despite the name, it is a course for everyone. It reminds me of the book [Linux Basics for Hackers](https://kea.nu/files/textbooks/humblesec/linuxbasicsforhackers.pdf) that was such good material it started being adopted as Linux groundwork in normal courses.

### [Linux Fundamentals by Hack The Box](/courses/linux-fundamentals-htb/)
A practical introduction to Linux, this is the Linux course that you sign up for when you do the course with Network Chuck. It is a good follow-up to his course as it covers the same topics. I would watcha video and use this as my homework assignment.
